# Bridge Development Report, March 17th

## Overview
In the development of the bridge functionality between the Theta and Polygon networks, we have made significant progress in establishing the core components necessary for cross-chain transactions. 

We are now able to transfer the `ReplayToken` token, across these two networks.
 
Below is a detailed progress report outlining completed tasks and pending actions.

## Completed Tasks

### Interface and Contract Development
- **IToken Interface**: Created to define the core functions that our custom token and bridge contracts interact with. This includes minting, transferring, allowance checks, and admin updates.
- **BridgeBase Contract**: Serves as the foundation for our bridge contracts, implementing core functionalities such as token burning and minting mechanisms, nonce processing to prevent replay attacks, and event emissions for tracking transfers.
- **Bridge Contracts**: Developed specific bridge contracts (`BridgeTnt` and `BridgeEth`) for each network (Theta and Polygon), extending the functionality of `BridgeBase` to cater to the nuances of each blockchain.
- **ReplayToken Contract**: A custom ERC20 token with additional features like minting control, staker rewards, and admin management functionalities tailored to our use case.

### Deployment and Monitoring Scripts
- **Deployment Scripts**: Prepared scripts for deploying the `ReplayToken` and bridge contracts on both the Theta and Polygon networks, ensuring that the bridge has the necessary permissions to mint tokens.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Developed monitoring solutions for both networks to track the status of cross-chain transactions, essential for operational oversight and troubleshooting.

### Token and Bridge Administration
- Adjusted the `ReplayToken` contract to allow minting exclusively by the admin, which, in the context of the bridge, involves setting the bridge contracts as admins on both sides of the transfer. This setup is crucial for maintaining control over the minting process during cross-chain transactions.

# To-Do List

### Security Improvements
[ ] - **Signature Verification**: Implement and test signature verification mechanisms to authenticate transactions across the bridge securely. This step is crucial for ensuring that only valid transactions are processed.
[ ] - **Nonce Management**: Enhance the nonce checking mechanism to robustly prevent replay attacks, ensuring each transaction is unique and processed only once.

### Transaction Rollback Mechanisms
[ ] - Develop a strategy to handle transaction failures, including a fallback mechanism that can rollback changes or refund transactions in case of errors. This feature is vital for maintaining trust and reliability in the bridge functionality.

### Infrastructure and Interface Development
[ ] - **Block Monitor Service**: Since the Theta network does not support WebSockets, create a service to monitor blocks and transactions, ensuring timely and accurate processing of cross-chain transfers.
[ ] - **User Interface**: Design and implement a user-friendly interface for initiating and tracking cross-chain transactions, improving the accessibility of the bridge for non-technical users.

### Testing and Auditing
[ ] - Conduct comprehensive testing of all components, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end transaction tests across networks.

[ ] - Arrange for an external audit of the smart contracts and bridge architecture to identify and rectify potential security vulnerabilities.

### Publication and Deployment
[ ] - Finalize documentation and prepare for the official launch of the bridge services.
[ ] - Deploy the fully tested and audited contracts to the mainnet environments of both Theta and Polygon networks.

## Conclusion
The development of the bridge between Theta and Polygon networks is well underway, with significant milestones already achieved in terms of contract development, deployment preparation, and initial monitoring setup. The remaining tasks are primarily focused on enhancing security, improving usability, and ensuring robust operation under all conditions. Once completed, this bridge will facilitate seamless cross-chain transactions, opening up new possibilities for token utility and blockchain interoperability.
